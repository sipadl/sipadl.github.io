    "intro" : "I have been immersed in the world of programming for over three years, gaining valuable experience along the way. As a fast learner, I am always eager to explore new programming languages. In my current role, I have been actively involved in the development of two projects using Laravel and two applications using Java Spring Boot. Additionally, I have undertaken numerous app development projects for clients, collaborating effectively with a skilled team. My expertise extends to managing and providing comprehensive data solutions for mobile developers through SQL/Non-SQL databases (APIs). I am also adept at identifying and resolving issues, utilizing languages such as JavaScript, Spring, and PHP in my day-to-day tasks. I embarked on my journey as a developer in 2019, and the subsequent years have been a rewarding experience of continuous growth and learning.",
